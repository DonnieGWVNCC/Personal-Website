                <h3 class="subheading">Who I Am</h3>
                <p>Hello, my name is Donald Garrison, but I like to go by Donnie. I am born and raised in Wheeling, West Virginia. I am 23 years old, and I graduated from Wheeling Park High School in 2017. 
                   I graduated from West Virginia Northern Community College in May of 2024, earning an Associate's Degree in Software Engineering. I have decided to pursue this career as it is something that has always intrigued me. I also believe it is a career with an endless amount of opportunity. 
                   Honestly, I'm not sure where this path will take me yet, but I'm very eager to get out there and join the workforce of web development!

                <h3 class="subheading">My Life</h3>
                <p>There are plenty of things I enjoy in this life of mine. Some of the most enjoyable things to me are fishing, only if I catch a fish of course. I also enjoy watching my favorite sports team the Pittsburgh Steelers, as well as attending WWE events when they come to town, playing video games such as Hollow Knight, and what I enjoy most is spending time with my girlfriend.
                   One new thing I have learned to love doing is writing code in Python and creating HTML documents. It is something I genuinely enjoy doing. To me, creating a program and having it run succesfully is one of the most satisfying feelings there is. 
                   Those are the things I enjoy the most in my life, I look forward to continuing enjoying these things, as well as finding new things.
