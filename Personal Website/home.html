                <h2 class ="subheading">The History of The Web</h2>
                <p>One thing I have enjoyed learning about is the history of the web. It has been interesting to learn about the beginning of something that was so small that has turned into one of the biggest things we have access to today.
                    The World Wide Web also known as, the web or abbreviated as "www", was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in the year of 1989. The web is made up of more documents than you could ever imagine. All of the web's documents are connected together by hypermedia links, also know as hyperlinks.
                    This linking makes the information on the internet incredibly easy to access for the user. The hyperlinks are written up in what is known as HyperText Markup Language, also known as HTML. 
                    After the links are written, they are then assigned to an online address with the name of Uniform Resource Locator, commonly known as the URL. 
                    It is crazy to think of how big of a development the internet became in just 33 years. We are now able to have a world of information at the press of a button. 
                </p>
                <h2 class ="subheading">The Art of Hyperlinks</h2>
                <p>Hyperlink is a term that is used in computing. The definition of a hyperlink is a link of a hypertext file or a document that leads the user to another location or file. 
                   The action of a hyperlink is activated when the user clicks on a blue, underlined statement. A blue hyperlink means it is a hyperlink that hasn't been visited, a purple link indicates a hyperlink that has been visited, and an active link that is being visited is red.
                   Hyperlinks are a big part of the web, it helps the user navigate between different pages of a website, it gets users to documents in one easy click, it is an essential part for us to use the web as the internet is made up of trillions of hyperlinks.  </p>
